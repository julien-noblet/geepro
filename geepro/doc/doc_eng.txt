							GEEPRO VERSION 0.1



							BEFORE USING GEEPRO

	Restart your computer, go into the BIOS or SETUP: press F2, F10, F12, or DELETE (depending
on your computer) as soon as it boots. There should be a setting somewhere for the parallel or LPT
port. Set this to EPP or ECP, not to Normal. If your computer does not have a parallel port setting,
Geepro may not work at all. PCI card parallel ports often do not need to be configured.

							USING GEEPRO

	Using Geepro is fairly self explanatory. There are three tabs along the top: Chip, Buffer, and
HW Test. In the top right corner is the programmer status: connected or disconnected. The button 
will update the programmer status. There are read, write, verify, etc. buttons in the toolbar relative
to the chip that you selected in the chip selection box.

	The Chip tab is where you select your chip and programmer. It also has the dip switch
configuration.The black on the dip switch is the actual switch knob.  The bottom right corner 
has two selection buttons: programmer and port. Geepro supports multiple programming devices 
that use parallel ports. Selecting a programmer will give you a photo of what they look like. Later
versions of Willem devices should be compatible with Willem 4.0 or PCB 3. Any and all feedback is
appreciated. 

	Geepro keeps the hex code read from a chip or file in the Buffer tab. You can edit or
modify anything in the buffer by right clicking a cell in the main window of the buffer. There are
various tools along the left side. 

	HW Test does anything from testing the hardware to putting a square wave signal on
the pins to reading data. 

							FILE

	Geepro supports saving the chip contents to file. Always save the code to a file name that ends
with .bin . Anything else may not save properly.

							ADDING CHIPS

	There is a "readme_plugins" file in the doc directory that gives a tutorial on adding chips.
The basics of most chip families are written already, feel free to add any chips you need or email the
developer. A lot of chips have a bigger or smaller chip already written to give you somewhere to start.
Please notify the developer of any chips you get to work. Do not report chips just because they might
work. Chips are added to Geepro only after they have been tested.

							TROUBLESHOOTING

	To ensure Geepro can access the parallel port you should add your user to group "lp". This
varies from distribution to distribution, most Linux distros have a Users And Groups program for that
purpose, otherwise Google it. 

	Timing and sequences can be improved by running Geepro as root. This is done by using 
the command "cd /your_folder_path/build_directory/" and then "sudo ./geepro" in a terminal window. 
Ordinarily you will not have to run Geepro as root. Use this if Geepro has trouble with read/write
errors or programming problems.

	Clicking the VPP box in the HW Test tab should turn on the red LED, and VCC should turn
on the orange LED.

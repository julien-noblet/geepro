							GEEPRO VERSION 0.1



							BEFORE USING GEEPRO

	Restart your computer, go into the BIOS or SETUP: press F2, F10, F12, or DELETE (depending
on your computer) as soon as it boots. There should be a setting somewhere for the parallel or LPT
port. Set this to EPP or ECP, not to Normal. If your computer does not have a parallel port setting,
Geepro may not work at all.

							USING GEEPRO

	Using Geepro is fairly self explanatory. There are read, write, verify, etc. buttons relative
to the chip that you selected in the chip selection box. The black on the dip switch is the actual
switch knob as of Geepro version 0.1. 
							ADDING CHIPS

	There is a "readme_plugins" file in the doc directory that gives a tutorial on adding chips.
The basics of most chip families are written already, feel free to add any chips you need or email the
developer. A lot of chips have a bigger or smaller chip already written to give you somewhere to start.
Please notify the developer of any chips you get to work. Do not report chips just because they might
work. Chips are added to Geepro only after they have been tested.

							TROUBLESHOOTING

	To ensure Geepro can access the parallel port you should add your user to group "lp". This
varies from distribution to distribution, most Linux distros have a Users And Groups program for that
purpose, otherwise Google it. 

	Timing and sequences can be improved by running Geepro as root. This is done by using 
the command "cd /your_folder_path/build_directory/" and then "sudo ./geepro" in a terminal window. 
Ordinarily you will not have to run Geepro as root. Use this if Geepro has trouble with read/write
errors or programming problems.
